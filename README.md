# java-mobile-prepaid-plans

The goal is to find the best plans for a customer based on usage. To keep
things simple, we only deal with the number minutes a user spent talking on the
phone. Let's say the customer's usage in a month is: N local minutes and M STD
minutes.

If the customer doesn't buy any plan he/she have to pay Rs. 1/min for both local and long
distance calls.

Each plan costs Rs. X, is valid for Y days and gives a discounted rate of Z
paise/min. A plan can give the discounted rate for both local and/or STD.

Ex. John's usage is 100 local minutes and 100 STD minutes in 30 days. If he
doesn't buy any plan he pays 100x1 + 100x1 = Rs. 200/30 days.
